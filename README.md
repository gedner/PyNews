# PyNews
News reader built with Pyqt5 for user interface.
Takes a given url (RSS FEED) and scrapes for links. Links displayed on MainWindow showing clickable Title and Description lines.
Also enters the links and scrapes for images, displays first image found on MainWindow togheter with Title and Description lines.
If no img found, it displays picture of an angry cat instead. Because why not.

The idea is that it looks like a regualar online newspaper. You can add more links from Your favourite media, and create your own
newsreader experience. No more clicking into a million news sites every morning.

cheers!
